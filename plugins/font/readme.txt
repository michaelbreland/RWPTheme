Finally official* web fonts plugin for wordpress. CLICK ON ANYTHING TO CHANGE IT(see screenshots)! Then change color, size and font face using sliders and color picker!
== Description ==
Finally official web fonts plugin for wordpress. No need for any coding at all! How? This plugin has an unique method of recognizing of what you click at!

Isn't that natural to just click on something, drag it, choose color from color picker, use slider to change the size and do other modifications visually?

All other plugins were telling me to write a CSS rule and make changes in admin panel without seeing the effect. That wasn't the way it should work for a normal person. Even for me, a developer, making changes by coding and not seeing it gives me reults far from perfection. It's important to see what's changing as you look at the page, and then fine tune it to get a perfect result.

That's why I created this plugin. To be able to see the size change as I drag the slider, and see color change as I use the color picker. To be able to see how the new font face looks like after selecting it from the list.
See the 1 image tutorial [how to use this wordpress fonts plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/font/screenshots/ "how to use this wordpres fonts plugin")

There are two modes:
Mode 1 - click on any element:
1. When being logged in as admin go to your home page, or any other page
2. Clic on "font settings" from the top bar and then on "Pick an element from the page"
3. Click on anything you want and name it
4. Change color, size and font face from over 1000 available or upload your own fonts
5. Save

Mode 2 - select a portion of text:
1. Go to the post editing page where you edit your posts and pages
2. Clic on "font settings" from the top bar
3. Select any portion of text. Can be a paragraph, one word or even a signle letter.
4. Change color, size and font face from over 1000 available or upload your own fonts
5. Update your post

Notice:
Always read each font's readme to make sure if it's free for your purposes! SOME fonts are free only for non commercial use, and some, probably just few need a small fee even for personal use.
